## üìù Project Description

The AI Eye Disease Analyzer is a proof-of-concept tool that demonstrates the power of AI in healthcare. Users can upload a retinal scan image, and the application will use a machine learning model to classify it into one of four categories: **Normal, Cataract, Diabetic Retinopathy, or Glaucoma**. Following the classification, it leverages Google's Gemini AI to provide a detailed explanation, precautions, and recommended next steps in multiple languages, complete with audio narration.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Interactive Landing Page:** A fully responsive HTML/CSS/JS page explaining the project's goals and technology.
-   **AI-Powered Classification:** Utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet-18 model (PyTorch) for accurate image classification.
-   **Generative AI Explanations:** Employs Google's Gemini AI to generate user-friendly and empathetic advice based on the classification result.
-   **Multi-Language Audio Support:** Converts the AI-generated advice into speech in several languages (including English, Hindi, Bengali, etc.) with different accent options.
-   **Modern User Interface:** A clean, intuitive, and visually appealing interface built with Streamlit.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application uses a powerful dual-AI approach:

1.  **Classification AI:** A retinal image uploaded by the user is first processed by a fine-tuned **ResNet-18 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. This model analyzes the image patterns and classifies the eye's condition.
2.  **Generative AI:** The classification result is then passed to **Google's Gemini AI**. A detailed prompt instructs Gemini to act as a health advisor, generating a comprehensive report that explains the condition, lists precautions, and suggests the next steps in a clear and empathetic tone.

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

**1. Prerequisites:**
-   Python 3.8 or higher
-   `pip` package manager

**2. Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Venky8249/Eye_diseases.git
cd Eye_diseases
```

**3. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**4. Install Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**5. Add Required Files:**
You need to add two crucial files to the root directory:

-   **Trained Model:**
    -   Download or place your trained PyTorch model file and name it `retinopathy_model.pth`.

-   **Google API Key:**
    -   Create a new file named `api_key.py`.
    -   Inside this file, add your Google API key like this:
      ```python
      api_key = "YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE"
      ```

**6. Run the Application:**
-   **To view the landing page:** Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.
-   **To run the analyzer tool:** Execute the following command in your terminal:
  ```bash
  streamlit run app.py
  ```
